# Volleyball Team Rotation Tool
This simple script uses list array manipulation to simulate and print all 6 stages of a volleyball team rotation.
To use it, you insert a base sample rotation including the names of your teammates in the front row and back row lists. Once the script executes, it'll provide all the rotations in order.

Creating it for a casual tournament as a captain, this script saved me time and effort in organising player positions and combinations.
A User Interface is the next important thing that can truly visualise each cycle.
Another plausible feature would be to integrate more detail for players(height and experience) and connect it with an LLM to provide ratings and feedback on the particular rotation strategy
