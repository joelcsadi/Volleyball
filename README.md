# Volleyball Team Rotation Tool
This simple script uses list array manipulation to simulate and print all 6 stages of a volleyball team rotation.
To use it, you insert a base sample rotation and once the script executes, it'll provide all the rotations.

Creating it for a casual tournament as a captain, this script helped in organising player positions and combinations.
A User Interface is the next important thing that can truly visualise each cycle.
